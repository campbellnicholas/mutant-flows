### ORDER OF OPERATIONS FOR ROLLING AGAINST ROT
1. Determine how many points of rot you have total after incurring more Rot Points.
2. Do you have the Rot Resistant talent? If yes, you have 3 modification Skill dice. If no, you do not gain additional dice to roll.
3. Do you have Rot Armor? If yes, what is the Armor Rating? That Armor Rating is the number of modification Gear dice you have. If you do not have Rot Armor, you do not gain additional dice to roll.
4. It's important to note that the Rot Resistant talent dice and the Rot Armor dice stack (if you have the Rot Resistant talent with a 3 armor rating and Rot Armor with an armor rating of 2, you will roll 3 skill dice and 2 gear dice).
5. For every point of rot you have incurred in total, you will roll your the skill dice and gear dice. For example, if you have have incurred 3 rot points, you will roll the dice you got for any armor or resistance 3 times. If you roll a 6 on the dice, you absorb that rot point (meaning you no longer have incurred that Rot). 
6. If you roll a 1 on the Gear dice, the Rot Suit is damaged and the armor rating decreases by 1. On subsequent protection rolls, your Gear dice should be reduced by the armor rating decrease (for example, if you had 3 rot points with a rot armor rating of 2 and on the first roll you roll a 1, the very next roll you should only roll one Gear die).
7.  If there are any rot points left after a player rolls their armor rating, then, for each rot point, the player rolls 1 die (if the player has 3 rot points remaining after rolling their armor OR if they didn't have armor, the player will roll 3 dice). These are Skill dice. If the player rolls one or more 1 on the dice, they will incur damage for the number of dice that rolled a 1.

### LOCATIONS OF INFORMATION REGARDING ROT
- Mutant: Year Zero Core Rulebook
    - Rot Level, Rot Attack, Effects of Rot, Rot Suits, Decontamination, Permanent Rot Points: pages 124-126
- Mutant: Year Zero: Elysium 
    - Rot Resistant talent: page 57

### ROT LEVEL
The worst thing about the Rot is that it permeates your body and builds up inside you over time. When you are contaminated by the Rot, you suffer Rot Points. Mark them in the check boxes on your character sheet.

Every sector in the Zone has a _Rot Level_, from zero and up. When you go into a new sector in the Zone, you will usually not know the Rot Level in it – so be careful and make sure you can get out quickly if you need to. And when you learn the Rot Level, don’t forget to note it down on the Zone map or the Zone log. The Rot Level determines at what frequency you take Rot Points:
- 0: __Zone oasis.__ The sector is as good as free from Rot. You suffer no Rot Points here. The Ark is located in such a sector.
- 1: __Weak Rot.__ In these sectors you get one Rot Point every day.
- 2: __Strong Rot.__ In such a sector you suffer one Rot Point every hour.
- 3: __Hotspot.__ Here, you will die quickly. You get one Rot Point every minute.

### ROT ATTACK
You can also get Rot Points from individual events or actions in the Zone, such as consuming contaminated grub or drink, wading through Rot-water or coming into contact with contaminated creatures. In these situations, you suffer one or more Rot Points directly. This is called a Rot attack.

__Grub and Water:__ Eating or drinking one ration of contaminated grub or water will typically give you one Rot Point.

### EFFECTS OF THE ROT
Every time you suffer a Rot Point, you must immediately roll a number of Base Dice equal to your total amount of Rot Points. For every 1 you roll on the dice, you suffer one point of damage (trauma to Strength).

### ROT SUITS
Gearheads can construct primitive Rot suits from bits of scrap (page 55). Typically, they provide a Protection Rating of 3 against the Rot -- this means you get to roll three Gear Dice every time you suffer a Rot Point -- if you roll one or more 6 on the dice, the suit absorbs the Rot Point. But for every 1 you roll  on the Gear dice, the Protection Rating decreases one step. The suit can be repaired, just like any piece of gear.

There are artifacts that can give you an even better protection against the Rot. The Rot-Eater mutation makes you immune to the effects of Rot-related trauma -- you suffer no damage from it -- but you still accumulate Rot Points.

### DECONTAMINATION
When you are back in the Ark or take refuge in some other Rot-free area, one Rot Point will leave your body every day. If you wash your body in clean water, half of your Rot Points (rounded up) go away immediately (you only get this effect from your first wash on returning to the Ark).

### PERMANENT ROT POINTS
When you are contaminated by the Rot, there is a risk that it will stay in your body forever. Every time you are about to lose one Rot Point, roll one Base Die. If you roll a =, the Rot Points stays, and becomes permanent. Mark this on your character sheet.

Permanent Rot Points stay with you for the rest of your life, no matter how hard you scrub yourself. Permanent Rot Points cannot be used by the Rot-Eater mutation.

### EXAMPLE
Krin is out in the Zone. On the first day, she only moves in sectors with Rot Level 1. In the evening, she suffers one Rot Point. She rolls on Base Die but does not roll 1, so she suffers no damage -- but the Rot Point remains. The next day, Krin walks into a sector with Rot Level 2 and spends an hour there. She suffers another Rot Point and rolls two Base Dice. Still doesn't roll a 1. Later that day, Krin wades across a contaminated creek -- a Rot attack -- and suffers another Rot Point. She now rolls three Base Dice, but stays lucky and gets no 1. At night, by the campfire, the GM gives her another Rot Point for spending the day (mainly) in Rot Level 1 sectors. She rolls four Base Dice and gets a 1 on two dice. Krin suffers two points
of damage.

The next day, Krin returns to the Ark to be decontaminated, which would eliminate two of her Rot Points immediately. She rolls two Base Dice, and rolls a 1 on one die -- one Rot Point washed away, but the other becomes permanent. After her decontamination, Krin has one permanent and two temporary Rot Points. As long as she stays in the Ark, she loses one temporary Rot Point per day -- but for each one, she must roll to see if it becomes permanent.

### MUTATIONS THAT CONCERN ROT
- __Corpse-Eater__. Eat raw meat, even several days after the prey's death, without suffering Rot Points. Small game counts as one ration of grub each. Bigger creatures -- or humanoids -- count as two rations.
- __Rot-Eater__. You are totally insensitive to the effects of the Rot. You take Rot Points normally, but you can: (1) Spend 1 Mutant Point to eliminate one point of trauma from the Rot, (2) Spend 1 Mutant Point to use one of your Rot Points to recover one point of any attribute. You can't use permanent Rot Points, (3) Emit concentrated Rot at an enemy at Arm's Length. Inflicts one point of damage for every Mutant Point you spend. Each point also requires one point of Rot, which is conusmed in the attack. You can't use permanent Rot.

### TALENTS THAT CONCERN ROT
- __Rot Resistant__. You have natural resistance to the Rot. It gives you an Armor Rating of 3 against Rot Points. This can be combined with the effects of protective gear. You roll Skill dice for checks against the armor.

### ADDITIONAL MECHANICS TO KNOW
- Trauma means a decrease to an attribute capacity. For example, a player may have 4 in a Strength attribute (which represents 4 dice on Strength-based rolls). If that player experiences trauma to their Strength attribute (known as "damage") of 1 point, the player will then only have access to 3 dice for their next Strength-based roll until they heal that attribute (4 hours of rest + 1 ration of grub). You can also experience Trauma to the Agility attribute ("fatigue"), Wits attribute ("confusion"), and Empathy attribute ("doubt"). Fatigue can be recovered through 4 hours of rest + 1 ration of water. Confusion can recovered through 8 hours of sleep. Empathy can be recovered through 4 hours of rest + a heart-to-heart conversation with another player.
- Armor and Shields: The effect of armor is determined by the Armor Rating. You can only wear one type of armor at a time. When you suffer damage, roll a number of Gear Dice equal to the Armor Rating. For every 6 you roll on the dice, the damage you suffer is reduced by one. Unless all damage is absorbed, for every 1 you roll on the Gear dice, the Armor Rating is decreased by one (except natural armor). The armor roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed. Armor can be repaired by Gearheads (page 55).

# Character Sheet

### Attributes

All Skill-based rolls are rooted in their based Attributes. Players get 14 points to spread across the four Attributes and no Attribute can have only 1 point and the only Attribute with 5 points is the characters "key" Attribute, dictated by player's role. Each point represents the number of Attribute dice (yellow) that they roll in conjunction with Skill dice (green) for Skill rolls. They are listed below as `Attribute name: data type`

- Strength: number
- Agility: number
- Wits: number
- Empathy: number

Each Attribute also has an associated "trauma" which decreases the number of Attribute dice available to a player. When the available dice decreases to 0, the player is "broken." They are listed below as `Trauma Name (associated Attribute): data type`

- Damage (Strength): number
- Fatigue (Agility): number
- Confusion (Wits): number
- Doubt (Empathy): number

### Skills

Skills are actions the player can take to interact with the world. They are represented by green dice. A player starts with 10 points to spread across the 11 Base Skills and 1 Specialist Skill (coming from the player's role), with at least 1 point in the Specialist Skill. Each of the Skills (Base and Specialist) are tied to a specific Attribute. The maximum number of points in any Skill at the beginning for players is 3 points. 

#### Base Skills

The base skills are available to all players. They are listed below as: `Skill Name (associated Attribute): data type`

- Endure (Strength): number
- Force (Strength): number
- Fight (Strength): number
- Sneak (Agility): number
- Move (Agility): number
- Shoot (Agility): number
- Scout (Wits): number
- Comprehend (Wits): number
- Know the Zone (Wits): number
- Sense Emotion (Empathy): number
- Manipulate (Empathy): number
- Heal (Empathy): number

#### Specialist Skills

Each role has a Skill that can only be used by that role. They are listed below as: `Skill Name (associated role - associated Attribute): data type`


- Intimidate (Enforcer - Strength): number
- Jury Rig (Gearhead - Wits): number
- Find the Path (Stalker - Agility): number
- Make a Deal (Fixer - Empathy): number
- Sic a Dog (Dog Handler - Agility): number
- Inspire (Chronicler - Empathy): number
- Command (Boss - Wits): number
- Shake It Off (Grunt - Strength): number

### Rot Points

Rot points are nodes of existing rot that could result in damage to character if left untreated. On the character sheet, the player would mark off boxes that represent the number of rot points they have accumulated (up to 10).

### Experience Points

Experience points are nodes of experience the player has gained each session. On the character sheet, the player would make off boxes that represent the number of experience points they have accumulated (up to 10).

### Mutation Points

Mutation points are nodes representing a player's capacity to use their character's mutation. On the character sheet, the player would make off boxes that represent the number of mutation points they have accumulated (up to 10).

### Name and Role

The player can create a name for their character and choose a role their character occupies.

- Name: text
- Role: select
    - Enforcer: option
    - Gearhead: option
    - Stalker: option
    - Fixer: option
    - Dog Handler: option
    - Chronicler: option
    - Boss: option
    - Grunt: option

### Appearance

The player can list out how their character looks with Face, Body, and Clothing.

- Face: text
- Body: text
- Clothing: text

### Gear

There is gear that each character can carry and each item has a particular weight associated with it. The player should be able to add items to the list. Items have weights associated with them on a scale represented by how many lines they can take up. A character can carry their Strength score x 2 number of lines. For example:

4 rations of grub = 1 line
4 rations of water = 1 line
Spiked bat = 1 line
Slingshot = 0.5 line
Torch = 0.25 lines

When listing them out in the character sheet, each line should have the name of the item and the weight of the item:

- Name: text
- Weight: number

If the summed weight of all the items carried equals more than the character's Strength score x 2, the character is experiencing an encumbrance.

#### Tiny Items
There are some items that are small enough to be negligible as far as weight. These can be listed in the same area as the rest of the gear but won't have a weight associated with them.

- Tiny Item Name: text

### Weapons

Characters can carry a number of weapons (but count in their Gear weight and should be listed in Gear). Each line of the Weapons section should display the name of the weapon, the number of Gear dice (black) the item adds to roles using the weapon (known as a Bonus), the damage the weapon can do with one hit, the range of how far the target can be from the weapon, and any special notes.

- Name: text
- Bonus: number (can be negative)
- Damage: number
- Range: "Arm's Length" | "Near" | "Short" | "Long"
- Special: text

### Armor

Character can wear armor to protect themselves from damage. The player will want to keep track of the kind of armor they are wearinig (name) and the rating which determines how much damage the armor can absorb, which means rolling Gear dice (black) to see how much the armor protects the character.

- Name: text
- Rating: number

#### Rot Suits

Rot suits are a special kind of armor that protects only against rot, not against damage. This can be worn separately from the armor.

- Name: text
- Rating: number

### Talents

Talents are special skills that players can learn outside of their role. Players can keep track of these by writing down their names.

- Name: text

### Mutations

Every character is a mutant and has at least one mutation that confers a special ability on the character. The player can keep track of these by writing down their names.

- Name: text
